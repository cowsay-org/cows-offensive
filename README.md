# cows-offensive

This is a supplemental archive of offensive and NSFW cows for cowsay. It exists as a separate package so the main cowsay package is family and work friendly without any modifications.

## cowsay-org

This repo you're looking at is part of [cowsay-org](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay), [Andrew Janke](https://github.com/apjanke/)'s fork of Cowsay.

## Installation

This repo is currently just an unstructured archive of cowfiles. There's no mechanism for installing it. The idea is to turn it in to an installable package, after the main cowsay package gets a bit more structured support for managing supplemental cowfile collections. For now, you can copy the files here into your site-cows directory if you want them.

## History

This cows-offensive package was created in 2024-08, when we removed one of the cows from main cowsay ([per a user request](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay/issues/46)), and needed a place to house it.

## License

Cows-offensive is licensed under the GPLv3, like the main cowsay package. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.
